<h1>Potential Projects in 2017-2018 for Final Year Students</h1>

<h2>Visualization of High-Dimensional Data</h2>
<p>In this big data era, it is not uncommon to tackle an optimization problem with many (more than 3) conflicting objective functions. For example, many customer satisfactions (such as cost, life time of the battery, affective design, weight, functions, etc.) are required to be optimized simultaneously in new mobile phone design. Apart from designing effective multi-objective optimization algorithms to find useful trade-off solutions, it is also of importance to understand the approximated solutions in a high-dimensional space. Parallel coordinates plot (PCP) is one of the most popular methods to visualize the high-dimensional data. However, PCP is still far from intuitive to have a well cognitive understanding. In this project, we will explore a novel parallel coordinates design integrated with points [1] to assist the decision maker to understand the high-dimensional approximated solutions. The basic idea is to project the high-dimensional data points in a low-dimensional subspace (typically 2D or 3D) by using some advanced manifold learning techniques [2].</p>

<h2>Interactive Multi-Objective Optimization and Decision Making</h2>
<p>This project shares the same background as <b>visualization of high-dimensional data</b> project, but focusing on a different issue. Instead of approximating the entire PF, which is huge in a high-dimensional space, it is more plausible to focus the computational resources upon a particular region of the PF, which fits the DM’s preferences most, as known as the region of interest (ROI). However, how to meaningfully represent the DM’s preference information is still open in both evolutionary multi-objective optimization (EMO) and multi-criteria decision making fields, especially when DMs themselves have little prior knowledge of the underlying problem. In this project, we will focus on data-driven methods, which use active learning or semi-supervised learning, to progressively approximate a meaningful representation of DM’s preference information [4] during the evolutionary process. In addition, we will also explore how to design a viable human-computer interaction mechanism <a href="5" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>5</a> to bridge the gap between DMs and optimization algorithms.</p>

<h2>Evolutionary Art</h2>
<p>Evolutionary art refers to the innovative use of evolutionary computation ideas, e.g., evolutionary algorithms, in creating art through interactive evolution. The art form could include pictures, paitings, 3-d objects, music, etc. Evolutionary art has many practical applications. It could be used in designing artefacts [1]. The primary aim of this project is to develop an interactive evolutionary art system as an App for an iPhone or Android phone. For example, we could have apps for the artistic stylization (transformation) of photographs into digital artwork.</p>

<h2>Software Effort Estimation as a Multi-objective Learning Problem</h2>
<p>Estimating the cost of a software project is a task of strategic importance in project management. Both over and underestimations of cost can cause serious problems to a company. For instance, overestimations may result in a company losing contracts or wasting resources, whereas underestimations may result in poor quality, delayed or unfinished softwares. The major contributing factor for software cost is effort [1]. Ensembles of learning machines are promising for software effort estimation (SEE), but need to be tailored for this task to have their potential exploited. A key issue when creating ensembles is to produce diverse and accurate base models. Depending on how differently different performance measures behave for SEE, they could be used as a natural way of creating SEE ensembles. It is well accepted that the ensemble of learning machines can be modeled as a multi-objective optimization problem. In this case, evolutionary multi-objective optimization (EMO) algorithms can be applied to approximate a set of trade-off solutions which can help the decision maker better understand the characteristics of different performance measures. In this project, our primary goal is to build a EMO driven ensemble learning machine, which can be well applied for SEE [2].</p>
