About EMO 2019:

EMO 2019 is the 10th Edition of International Conference Series on
Evolutionary Multi- Criterion Optimization (EMO), aiming to continue the
success of previous EMO conferences. We will bring together both the
EMO, Multiple Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) communities, and other
related fields and, moreover, focus on solving real-world problems in
government, business and industry. Michigan is the birthplace of genetic
algorithms research and EMO 2019 will plan on celebrating past 50 years
of research and development in evolutionary computation and 10th edition
of EMO conference series.

Conference Format:

The conference will be in single session format, with papers provided as
either oral or as poster presentations. The conference format will include:

     Keynotes
     Tutorials
     EMO Sessions
     MCDM Sessions
     Industry Sessions
     Industry Booths for Software/Application Demonstration
     Poster Session
     Panel Session (to be finalized)


Topics of interests:

We aim to discuss all aspects of EMO development and deployment,
including (but not limited to):

     EMO for handling of continuous, combinatorial and/or mixed-integer
problems
     Constraint handling approaches
     Uncertainty and noise handling approaches
     Many-objective optimization
     Theoretical foundations
     Preference handling techniques
     Performance evaluation and metrics
     Multiobjectivization
     Local search techniques
     Hybrid approaches
         Point and population-based hybrids
         EMO and MCDM hybrids
     Stopping criteria
     Parallel EMO models and implementations
     Test functions and benchmark problems
     Algorithm selection approaches
     Comparative studies
     Metamodeling methods in EMO
     EMO in Bilevel and generic hierarchical optimization
     Knowledge-driven EMO
     Large-scale optimization
     Real-world applications
     EMO algorithm implementation
